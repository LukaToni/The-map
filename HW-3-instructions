The map is represented as a network of x times y cells. In some cells are mine. 
Write a program that calculates the minimum number of movements beyond the boundaries of the cells 
(ie true 4-adjacency), which can be reached from the cell (0,0) in cell (x-1, y-1) and never step on a mine. 

The program should first read the size of a map(x, y) then the position of all of the mines,
wherein the position of each mine described by its coordinates. 

The program should display the number of movements and the search for the end of the line.
Fullest map contains 1000 x 1000 pixels. If the path between the initial and final cell due to the 
unfavorable position of min can not be found, the program displays -1.
